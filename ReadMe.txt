Twitter2015 and Twitter2017 
We used data from JefferyYu, from which you can download the original data. Since we need to split the training set, we provide the split training set, which you can download here:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Tx1LtfS4TgxYuy3Af2ut2MZ_boKnqfUG. Of course, you can also use your own way to split the training set.

Note: In data/twitter2015 and data/twitter2017 at the link we provided , train.txt is the original complete training set, train_pre.txt is 80% of the data randomly selected from train.txt for training the multimodal and unimodal models, and train_rl.txt is 20% of the data randomly selected from train.txt for training the data discriminator.In our experiment, three files were integrated to participate in the experiment.
